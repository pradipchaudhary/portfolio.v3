                <p>React Server Components offer a revolutionary approach to rendering React applications. They allow server-side rendering (SSR) of components, reducing the JavaScript load on the client side and improving performance. In this blog, weâ€™ll explore what React Server Components are, their benefits, and how they work.</p>

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>React Server Components aim to enhance web performance by offloading some of the rendering and data-fetching responsibilities to the server. This feature enables developers to  build more efficient and faster web applications by minimizing the JavaScript that needs to be sent to the client.</p>
